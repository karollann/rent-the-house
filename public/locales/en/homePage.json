      "Great place and experience! We were a group of 6adults and 2 infants. We could easily fit another pair of adults. The estate has almost all the amenities you could think of (apart of washing machine), with beautiful, big garden. One watch-out - the access to lake is approx 200m away. Staying there is like living at your best friend’s place; the hosts are super friendly and welcoming.",
      "Spacious house, very well-equipped. For two families with a total of 5 infants. A large plot of land around the house is a big draw for the babies. The place had everything I needed to enjoy my time. Very convenient location with close access to the lake. I have no reservations. Just an extra compliment for the great contact with the owners.",
      "A house with a soul!! Beautiful wooden interior with full equipment of four rooms and two bathrooms. A well-stocked kitchen was well-stocked and the fresh coffee from the La Kafo roastery in Augustow was delicious on the deck overlooking the lake. Surrounded by old trees, the vast garden offers plenty of privacy and a chance to relax and unwind. Dock, boat, and bikes provide the right amount of fun. Highly recommend!!!"
